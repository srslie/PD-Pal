# PDPal: Professional-Development-Pal

Turing School of Software and Design emphasizes the professional development of students alongside building up technical skills.

Learning to code is fun! Learning to write resumes, set goals, and search for jobs? Not as much fun.

Until now! At >>>>>>>>>[PDPAL](), we've curated jobs that specifically contain skills learned in Turing's Front-End Development Program. No more typing out "Javascript" or "React" into endless job aggregators. And when you like a job, boom, save it! If you applied, boom, log it!

Users can: 

- See a display of jobs curated for students graduating Turing's Front-End Development Program.
- Click a job to see more details
- Allow for jobs to be denoted as "Favorites" or "Applied to"

This is the final solo project of Turing School Mod 3, and synthesizes the needs of professional development with front-end technology. 

## Goals

In this project, my goal was to develop an app that served the needs of a specific audience. Often we talk about accessiblity and ensuring we can develop well to a diverse audience. Sometimes we neglect to highlight the importance of developing something very useful to a specific audience niche. Highlighting those user stories and catering to that scope helps make a useful tool for that demographic and scopes development appropriately.

## Technologies

This project was utlized:

- **ES6 Javascript** with a focus on DRY, SRP, OOP code
- **React** & **React Router** with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- **Cypress** end-to-end testing
- **CSS** broken out into modular, logical stylesheets
- A **CSS [normalize](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/)** file for browser compatability
- **Accessibility testing** using [aria labels](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-label) and [Colorblinding](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorblinding/dgbgleaofjainknadoffbjkclicbbgaa?hl=en) checks alongside **semantic HTML**
- **Webpack** bundling 
- **Github pages** deployment
- **Git workflow**, PR template, a kanban project board, wireframing, and self-management of design and development modeled after Agile
- **Material-UI** dev dependency to help with accessibility tooltips and drop-menu

## Contributors

This app was coded by me, [Alice Ruppert](https://www.srslie.com/), following a [spec](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-3/niche-audience.html) by Turing School staff.

Special thanks to my mentor, [Scott Schipke](https://github.com/sschipke) for his technical support, and my partner for the love and support.

## Future Iterations

I was happy to build this out over the course of a week, but had more ideas than I had time to implement!

While no further iterations are planned, future improvements might include:
- More refactoring!
-
